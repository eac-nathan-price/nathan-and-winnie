<p>We missed watching Supernatural when it first aired. But instead of simply binging the show, I had the idea to watch it like it was 2005 all over again and intersprse the episodes with other shows of the era. I scraped wikipedia for the original air dates of dozens of popular shows, a mix of old favorites and classics we'd never gotten around to watching, and assembled a spreadsheet which would function as a TV guide. Although we decided to primarily focus on SuperWhoLock, the Tumblr Trifecta.</p>
